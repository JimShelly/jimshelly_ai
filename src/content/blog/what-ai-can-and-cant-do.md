# What AI Can—and Can’t—Do For Your Business

Let’s start with a reality check.

AI isn’t magic.  
It’s not your new CEO.  
And it’s not going to fix a broken business overnight.

But it *can* be incredibly helpful—if you ask it to do the right things.

## ✅ What AI *Can* Do:
- Draft follow-up emails, proposals, and reports  
- Summarize messy notes or transcripts  
- Handle routine customer questions  
- Help organize your documents and internal info  
- Save you hours of clicking, copying, and pasting

These are high-leverage, repeatable tasks AI excels at.

## ❌ What AI *Can’t* Do:
- Fix a business model that’s already struggling  
- Replace human judgment, experience, or nuance  
- Magically understand your tone or company culture  
- Run your operations without oversight  
- Make good decisions with bad data

If your business is already working decently, AI can take it from good to great.  
If it’s a bit of a mess? AI will just make it a *faster* mess.

**Preparation matters.**  
Not for the robots—but for *you*.
