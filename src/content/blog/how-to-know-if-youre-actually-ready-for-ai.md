# How to Know If You're Actually Ready for AI

You don't need to be an engineer.  
You don't need to be a big company.  
But you *do* need to be ready.

Here's a quick gut-check to see where you stand:

## ðŸ§­ The AI Readiness Checklist

âœ… You know your top 3 most time-consuming tasks  
âœ… You've written down at least *some* of your processes  
âœ… You know what "good enough" looks like in your daily work  
âœ… You're willing to test small changes, not demand instant perfection  
âœ… You'd rather improve systems than just "try a shiny new tool"

**If you checked 3 or more:** You're in a great spot to begin exploring AI.  
**If not:** That's okayâ€”it just means your first AI "project" might be... getting a little more organized.

And that's still progress.

> AI won't save you from chaosâ€”it will just amplify it.  
> But if you've got a decent system, even a scrappy one? AI can help you level up faster than you think.
